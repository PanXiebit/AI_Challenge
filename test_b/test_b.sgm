<seg id="3044"> But you can have the hemorrhoids and the swollen ankles, </seg>
<seg id="3045"> A few of those old mini bottles off of a cart? </seg>
<seg id="3046"> The more I'm into somebody, the greater the odds that it's gonna end badly. </seg>

<seg id="3048"> He was found with his arms and legs bound with a clothesline, </seg>
<seg id="3049"> Heaven is for all of us, not just for minors. </seg>
<seg id="3050"> I mean, I just wanted to protect her from everything that's gone on around here. </seg>
<seg id="3051"> So the chromosomes can break and be rejoined, and the product of that is gametes that are different. </seg>
<seg id="3052"> But do I think for a second it's serious with him? </seg>
<seg id="3053"> It would have been better if she was like you </seg>
<seg id="3054"> Yeah. It's not just a job though. It's an adventure. </seg>
<seg id="3055"> Put the bag down. - put your bags down. Let's go. </seg>
<seg id="3056"> It's a shame he could never provide for a woman of her. </seg>

<seg id="3058"> You're a legend to him. - if only he knew it. </seg>
<seg id="3059"> Friendly service, only the highest quality amenities and plenty of free perks make us stand out. </seg>
<seg id="3060"> Yes. I just always thought it was a waste of time. </seg>
<seg id="3061"> His couch is a little short on closet space, so... </seg>
<seg id="3062"> If you don't go, I'll assume you're not serious about your future... </seg>
<seg id="3063"> If he's not your friend, why is he buying you a keg? </seg>
<seg id="3064"> You think the crash was my fault, don't you? You blame me. </seg>
<seg id="3065"> I don't wanna be just another face in the crowd, </seg>
<seg id="3066"> It would be very difficult for any of us to want to vote her out tonight. </seg>
<seg id="3067"> You quit your job, but you're still working on the twins' science project? </seg>
<seg id="3068"> cause I hope you're not thinking of putting all that glimmer in play. </seg>
<seg id="3069"> You tell them, if he comes to Boston, I'm out. </seg>
<seg id="3070"> Yeah. - and I... I just... I have to say that </seg>
<seg id="3071"> Yeah, my ring tone. Kind of my favorite song, "rocket man. </seg>
<seg id="3072"> Because I wanted to hear what you had to say. </seg>
<seg id="3073"> It might be good for you to take the edge off. </seg>
<seg id="3074"> Finally I can try on a skirt and get somebody's honest opinion. </seg>
